### List of Programs

##### Classes and Objects

This program is just a class example on classes and objects in Java.

##### Car Dealership

This program is used to inventory six vehicles and their information in Java class objects.

##### Lottery

This program allows the user to enter six numbers and then compares with six randomly drawn numbers. It uses a list to allow the user to enter their numbers separated with spaces, rather than a new input for every new number.

##### Yahtzee

This program rolls six dice and stores it in an array. It then checks to see if they're all equal. This program could still be updated to include more scoring categories.

##### Carnival

This is not entirely my code. It is modified to fit the criteria outlined in the assignment.

###### Diclaimer: This code is here only for reference.
